This API enables cross-origin GET requests to read-only Blaseball endpoints:

- /database
- /events
- /api/getTribute
- /api/getIdols

Cookies are disabled and stripped from requests. Redirects are not followed, as they should be
handled by the browser.

To prevent the use of the proxy for non-cross-origin use, the API requires the Origin header to be
set. To avoid unnecessary preflight (OPTIONS) requests, it's recommended to not manually set this
header in your code.
